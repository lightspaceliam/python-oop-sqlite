# Python OOP SQLite

# Purpose

I want to design an object oriented pattern, similar to what I use in .NET Core to perform CRUD operations to a persistence medium. This POC (proof of concept) will allow me to expand my knowledge of Python and learn how to take advantage of patterns such as inheritance & repository.

#Technology Stack

- Python 3
- SQLite
